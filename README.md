# 🚀 Personal Portfolio – Padamata Rohith Mano

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website!  
This project was built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to showcase my journey as a student and developer.

## 🛠️ How I Built It

### 🔹 1. HTML Structure
- I started by designing the layout in plain HTML.
- The structure includes sections like:
  - Hero (Introduction)
  - About Me
  - Skills
  - Education
  - Experience
  - Projects
  - Footer with social links

### 🔹 2. CSS Styling
- I wrote responsive and modern CSS using `flexbox` and `media queries`.
- Added custom styles for:
  - Buttons, grids, cards, and layout spacing
  - Light gradients and rounded corners for aesthetics

### 🔹 3. Scroll Animations
- Integrated **[ScrollReveal.js](https://scrollrevealjs.org/)** to animate elements as they appear in the viewport.
- This gives smooth visual transitions for sections like About, Skills, Projects, etc.

### 🔹 4. Project Showcase
- Included real projects like:
  - Tic Tac Toe
  - Stone Paper Scissors
  - SonusCloud (Flask + SQL)
  - Pokémon Type Guesser (MERN stack)
  - Currency Converter
- Linked them or explained them in brief in the **Projects** section.

### 🔹 5. Assets Integration
- Added a profile picture: `Images/photo.jpg`
- Uploaded my resume: `Images/resume.pdf`
- Linked all social handles and email contact
